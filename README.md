Implementation of the Gray-Scott [reaction-diffusion-system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction%E2%80%93diffusion_system) in python.

Reaction-diffusion-systems can model various processes in nature. Often in situations where complex pattern emerge from simple ones. Today reaction-diffusion-systems are popular because of the interesting "organic" patterns they create. The model has a set of free parameters and  there exist different regimes in the parameter space where different patterns are able to exist. In the picture below the parameters vary over the 2D-space as to interpolate between different kinds of patterns. There is one regime in the form of a ring with lines surrounded by evenly distributed dots.
